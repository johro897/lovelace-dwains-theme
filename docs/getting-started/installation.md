# Installation
**Dwains Dashboard is only compatible with HA 0.107 or newer!**

---

Before we are getting started on anything, make you sure you make a backup of you current Home Assistant setup.

Dwains Dashboard highly depends on HA groups If you don't know how to work with groups, [read this first](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/). 

With groups you can combine multiple entities into one. For example you have 3 lights in your living room `light.living_room_1`, `light.living_room_2` and a switch `switch.living_room_3`. You can combine these in 1 group as follow:
```
living_room_lights:
  name: Living Room Lights
  entities: 
    - light.living_room_1
    - light.living_room_2
    - switch.living_room_3
```
You then can use `group.living_room_lights` in my dashboard config.

#### Short explanation on Dwains Dashboard

My dashboard has the slogan "An auto generating Home Assistant Lovelace UI Dashboard". You still need to define your house in so called 'Dwains Dashboard Config files'. Working with these files is not that hard and is fully explained in the docs here. The dashboard will be automatic generated on the basis of these config files.

## Step 2 - Extract the content

1. Unzip the file you just downloaded.
2. Inside this folder you will see a folder called `custom_components` copy this folder.
3. Go to the main folder of your Home Assistant installation. This is the folder where you config is. (Hint: its the folder where for example the files `ui-lovelace.yaml` and `configuration.yaml` are located).
4. Paste the `custom_components` to the main folder of your Home Assistant installation.

You will end up with having `/config/custom_components/dwains_dashboard` or if you are running a venv installation it would look like `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/custom_components/dwains_dashboard`.
