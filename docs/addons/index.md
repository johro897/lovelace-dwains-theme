# Addons

With Dwains Dashboard Addons you can extend the dashboard functionality with own addons without changing any of the dashboard cores code. This way you can always update to the latest version without problems but still add own views/cards.

Community made addons for Dwains Dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-dashboard-addons).

There are a few type off addons possible right now:

### Rooms Addons
With rooms addons you can add own functionality to rooms. You can add a own button on a room page which links to a custom page. It can also parse some data to that view. 

### More page addons
With more page addons you can still add own pages to Dwains Dashboard, you even can put them in the main navbar! Let's say you want a page with some statistics or just an extra page with some cards. Then more page addons is the way to go.

### Persons addons
With persons addons you can add own cards to a person page. Like for example a map, traveling time to work or home. It can also parse some data to that view. 

### House information addons
With house information addons you can add own cards to the global house information page. Like for example an calendar, traveling time to work or home. It can also parse some data to that view. 

### Popup addons
With popup addons you can add own card(s) to a popup of an entity. So for example if you click on `switch.diswasher` you also see the power usage of the diswasher.
