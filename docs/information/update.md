# Updating Dwains Theme 

If there is a update of Dwains Theme here is how to install it.

### Step 1 - Download Dwains Theme latest release
1. Download the [latest release from the release page][link](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme/releases).

**Each release has information on that page with how to install it as an update!**

### Step 2 - Extract & move the download

1. Unzip the file you just downloaded. 

2. Make a backup of the folder `dwains-theme/configs` and `dwains-theme/addons` this is very important!

3. If you use the `custom_resources.yaml file`, then backup that one too (`dwains-theme/resources/custom_resources.yaml`)

3. Remove the folder `dwains-theme` in your main HA folder.

4. Copy the content of the folder you just downloaded to the root of your Home Assistant installation.

5. Copy the `configs` and `addons` folders back to to the folder `dwains-theme`. If you use the `custom_resources.yaml` file, then copy this back into dwains-theme/resources.

### Step 3 - Reboot Home Assistant

Reboot Home Assistant! After this check if you got the new version number in More page -> Theme settings (bottom of page).

## Version info

Version numbering explained (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
1. MAJOR version: when there are big and incompatible changes.
